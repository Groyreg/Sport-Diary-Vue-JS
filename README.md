# Sport-Diary-Vue-JS
It's the comercial project, which helps users to create events with any type, to keep a training calendar and to watch out in own meals. 
Unfortunately, more data is taken from the server, so some of the application functionality will be unavailable.

However, I will show any screenshots from the working version.

Also you can copy yourself a project and see the available part and evaluate the code itself. To do this, enter the following commands in the console:

1. git clone https://github.com/Groyreg/Sport-Diary-Vue-JS.git
2. cd sport-diary-vue-js
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

This is a page of the diary on which you can add new events, also watch, edit and delete current events on the selected day.
